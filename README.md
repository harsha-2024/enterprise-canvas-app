# Enterprise Canvas App Kit (Banking Operations)

This downloadable kit gives you a **large-scale, robust Canvas app blueprint** with:

- Feature-complete **screen & component YAML** (copy/paste into **Power Apps Studio → Code View**)
- **Dataverse data model** (tables/columns) in CSV, ready for import/setup
- **Power Fx** formulas for performance (delegation), error-handling, telemetry, role-based UX
- **CLI-first** scripts to create a starter `.msapp` and package a solution (with notes on preview/deprecation)
- **Azure DevOps pipeline** sample for ALM

> ⚠️ **Important**: The `*.pa.yaml` files shown in docs are primarily generated by Studio/Git integration and may be read-only. This kit provides **Code View–pasteable YAML** snippets and **Power Fx** to compose your app quickly in Studio. For ALM, prefer **Power Platform Git Integration** over `pac canvas pack/unpack` which are **deprecated/preview**. See `/scripts/USAGE.md`.
